# 📰 Fake News Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
It was developed in March 2025 during my professional work phase and uploaded here for reference.  

The goal is to classify news articles as **real or fake**, contributing to efforts in combating misinformation.

## 🔬 Methodology  
- **Dataset**: [e.g., Kaggle Fake News Dataset / LIAR dataset]  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Tokenization and stop-word removal  
  - Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)  
  - TF-IDF / Word2Vec / Transformer-based embeddings  
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTM / BiLSTM / Transformer (update with the actual models used).  
- **Frameworks**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch, NLTK, Pandas.  
- **Training**: Achieved [98%] accuracy, [0.86] F1-score on test data.

## ⚙️ Features  
- Binary classification: **Fake vs Real news**  
- End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing → feature extraction → model training → evaluation → prediction  
- Modular design, making it easy to extend for other NLP classification tasks  

---

## 📊 Results  
- **Accuracy**: [e.g., 94.2%]  
- **Precision/Recall/F1**: [Insert metrics if available]  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Demonstrates effective classification performance  

*(Optional: Insert sample result plots or confusion matrix images here)*
